<p><em>Infrastructure modernization:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Led migration of stack build and release pipelines from
Jenkins/Tekton to Buildkite, making key architectural decisions;
designed a pipeline generator (Go + custom DSL) generating 13 pipelines
for 16 teams to standardize delivery and enable reuse; reduced 20,000+
lines of YAML and improved performance by 50%.</li>
<li>Reduced stack snapshots and staging build time from 8+ hours to 2.5
hours by evolving from sequential builds to parallel product builds with
ephemeral CI workers, then implementing asynchronous builds.</li>
<li>Improved public RPM/DEB repository rebuild time from 8+ hours to 2
hours; developed an Artifactory-based enhancement migrating rebuilds
from VMs to Artifactory while maintaining S3 sync for external
repositories.</li>
<li>Enabled doubling the number of versions maintained and released each
year, and a shift from single-release operation to running up to 4
releases in parallel.</li>
<li>Reduced operational toil and delivery risk through self-service
tooling, standardization, and repeatable operating patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cloud platform engineering:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Built a Kubernetes controller in Go (custom CRD + reconciliation
loop) integrating Argo Workflows to enable self-service deployments with
consistent orchestration; enabled 11 teams to migrate 57 services to
self-service GitOps deployments across 6 environments.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Customer Zero: owner for coordinating internal pre-release
validation across 10+ teams, enabling early testing of release build
candidates.</li>
